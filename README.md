# DIVING INTO VIRTUAL IDENTITY: EXPLORING THE RISE OF VIRTUAL EMBODIMENT THROUGH NARRATIVE

This repository contains the finalized code used to create the VR experiences that formed part of my thesis 'DIVING INTO VIRTUAL IDENTITY: EXPLORING THE RISE OF VIRTUAL EMBODIMENT THROUGH NARRATIVE'.

The project focuses on exploring the relationship between the concept of virtual embodiment and narrative in virtual reality experiences. The main objective has been to understand the concepts of virtual embodiment and self-presence, to investigate how the immersive narrative can influence the sense of embodiment in users and to test this through an empirical test.

To achieve this goal, we have carried out the study of different previous studies and we have proposed an experiment composed of two virtual reality experiences from scratch, one focused on the empowerment of the immersive narrative for the identification of the user with the character and the other with the usual narrative. The construction of the experiment has required the design and construction of two immersive game-like experiences, complete and functional, which form the basis of the tests.

More than 40 subjects have been tested. The results obtained provide a first insight into the initial hypothesis and highlight the importance of narrative in creating a more immersive and emotional experience for virtual reality users. In future work, it will be necessary to increase the number of subjects and evaluate whether this difference is statistically significant between the two proposals, in order to conclude with solid evidence the influence of narrative in the identification of the player with their avatar.
